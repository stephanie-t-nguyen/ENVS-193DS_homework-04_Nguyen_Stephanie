### Project: Linear Regression Model of Trout Length vs Weight

The following uses data from EDI Data Portal (<https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-ntl.6.34>) and uses a linear regression model to answer the question: how does fish length predict fish weight for trout perch (across all sample years)?

### Files Overview

The two main folders are data and code. The "data" folder contains the file ntl6_v12.csv which is used for the linear regression model. The "code" folder contains homework_4\_code.qmd where the code for the model is stored and it's .docx equivalent.

### Methods and Results 

The data was briefly investigated for missing data and linear relationships. Then, a linear regression test was run. The calculated p-value was less than 0.001, so the null hypothesis could be rejected. This suggested that fish length can be used to predict fish weight.
